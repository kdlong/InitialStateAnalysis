'''
Prompt and Fake Rate methods as defined in AN-2010/261.
This method computes the number of prompt and fake events for a given
number of leptons with associated efficiencies and number of events
passing loose and tight selections.
For now, only the 3-lepton case is coded. The generic case will be added
later.
